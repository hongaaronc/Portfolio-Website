                        Here are two songs that I liked that I transcribed so I could play in a band.

                        I occassionally have tried writing songs as a hobby. I don't really have much formal music composition training, so I pretty much go off of what sounds good to me. Here are some original pieces I made.

                        "Ambient Rock Demo" was written in my first year out of college. It was inspired by the Silent Hill 1 theme, mostly its instrumentation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Chiptune Demo" was written in my third year of college. It is inspired mostly by Anamanaguchi and Coldplay.
                    </p>

                        "Ambient Rock Demo" was written in my second year of college when I was working on <i>AT SUNDOWN</i>. I was mostly trying to write out thoughts on how a Wild-West themed soundtrack would work in the game. It is lightly inspired by the song "Red Sand (Swift)" by Bill Laurance.

                        "Four Seasons of Rock" was from when I was in middle school.
